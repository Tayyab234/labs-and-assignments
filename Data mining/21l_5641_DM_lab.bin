Just arrived there was a small problem with the hot water but Lea was very attentive and she had already organized an intervention that she has followed personally. The apartment was clean and equipped. A great stay!\\nLea was great at communicating before our stay and her husband was very helpful when we checked in. We really liked the area - the only thing I would say is that there isn't a great view from the apartment which we expected from the photos.\\nLea was so friendly and helpful and her little flat was amazing. I can only give her my best recommendations.\\nIt's a very cozy apartment and in a great location. Lea is very friendly and she's easy to reach if needed. She gave us great recommendation for lunch spots! One thing though, it's some narrow spiral staircases that lead to the apartment so people with large luggages might find it difficult. It wasn't a problem for us and once we are in the apartment we felt very relaxed because of the simple but charming decor and comfy sofas and bed.\\nLea was the kindest host and the apartment was immaculate and had everything I needed for my stay. The neighborhood is wonderful too. I would stay at Lea's place again in a heartbeat.\\nLovely apartment with everything I needed! Great communication and everything went smoothly. Thanks a lot!\\nAmazing apartment, perfect for our trip, had everything we needed. Lea was very helpful and replied to me straight away if I had any questions. Thank you!\\nLea's place is in a strategic positon, is very quiet and clean. She is a very special host, kind and precise. Thanks Lea! I hope to come back.\\nSuper accueil, super appart, tout \\u00e9tait parfait... Go go go ;)))\\nWe were five colleagues staying in Lea's apartment for a training session in Paris. Very clear communication, amazing, spacious apartment, and perfect location on a quiet street (between the Canal and Republique). Would definitely recommend a stay here.\\nVery good Place to stay. Close to important locations. The apartment is small but with everything we need.\\nThe reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\\nWhat a great little place :) quiet, clean and very well located. Matt was very welcoming and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!\\nS\\u00e9jour parfait, merci L\\u00e9a.\\nWe had a fabulous stay in Lea's gorgeous Parisian apartment. The apartment was much bigger then we expected and the photos do not do it justice. Lea was lovely and extremely responsive to all of our correspondence. I would highly recommend this apartment as it is beautiful, and truly Parisian chic. This is a fabulous apartment.\\nWhat a fantastic apartment! Beautifully furnished and in a great location for exploring Paris. There was 10 of us staying in the apartment and we had plenty of room. Lea is a great host, very welcoming and gave us lots of information about the area. Would definitely recommend staying here!\\nLea was a perfect host and the appartment was very nice. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Paris!\\nLovely appartment, lovely area and great host. Couldn't ask for more!\\nWe could not have asked for a better apartment than this one! It was well situated and a great big size for 8 people. Lea was a wonderful host; she made reservations for us at restaurants and took her time to welcome us to the apartment. If I ever go back with a group of friends or family I will look no further. What a great place!\",\n          \"Phillipe, Thanks so much for the lovely stay. The Marais location was prefect and the apartment was exactly what we needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. I especially loved the loft view of rooftops! Thanks again, Carolyn\\nL'appartement est coquet et charmant. Il est bien plac\\u00e9 dans un quartier calme et agr\\u00e9able. Il contient les \\u00e9quipements n\\u00e9cessaires pour passer un bon s\\u00e9jour. La literie est propre et agr\\u00e9able. Nous y avons pass\\u00e9 un excellent moment. Notre h\\u00f4te nous a conseill\\u00e9 un march\\u00e9 pittoresque \\u00e0 proximit\\u00e9\\nGreat spot to enjoy this stylish part of town, and in easy reach of major sights. Cool and compact apartment, great for a short break. Hosts really helpful.\\nWe enjoyed our stay at this quaint apartment in a great location. Philippe was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We recommend this apartment to everyone. thank you Philippe!\\nThe apartment is so sweet. I loved it. I really loved it. Paris is grand. The Marais is filled with little shops with everything you could ever want. Personally, I felt safer here than I do in Boston, and I live in Boston. Philippe is the best host ever, I fell in luv. I would and will go back as often as I can.\\nBeautiful mini apartment in a fabulous neighborhood. Perfect.\\nCharming little apartment situated on the 5th floor of typical Parisien building. Great location, only 5 minute walk away from Rue de Froissart metro stop. We arrived early before the previous guests had departed so our host arranged for his friend in the same building to look after our bags. We met our host later on that day and he gave us the keys and showed us around apartment, which was in prefect condition. There are a lot of stairs up to the apartment so if you have knee problems or if you are old, this apartment may not be suitable for you. Also, any noises coming from the toilet can be heard quite clearly throughout the apartment, so you might want to be quite comfortable with whoever you stay with here! Overall though, a great apartment\\nI had never been to Paris and this apt was in a great location to walk and take the metro from. Philippe was easy to coordinate with for checkin and check out. Thanks!\\nVery nice contact and a small - but extremely lovely! - apartment! Clean, calm, and old Paris-style classy. The location is perfect for going anywhere by foot or by metro, there are tons of restaurants, caf\\u00e9s, brasseries and shops right outside the door. I would recommend this place to anyone fit enough to climb 5 flights of stairs.\\nGreat place! Real good value for money! Super kind host and, although a very small space, it has everything you (website hidden)'s very quite and clean and with a beautiful authentic Parisian touch; you feel like you live in in Paris. The Marais is the hottest area at the moment, so you won't regret staying here. Philippe even recommended me his favourite restaurant (you have to ask him ; ) which was sublime. I traveled alone and felt completely safe and relaxed, which is absolutely worth the climbing of a few stairs. Just book it\\nWe arrived late to Leece due to all trains being completely to (it was a holiday) but our host arrived a second time to pick us up at the train station. We felt so at ease knowing he would take us to his apartment. The apartment is even better than is pictured! It was amazing and we walked everywhere. But if you prefer to take the city bus it is located just one block down the street at no cost. We absolutely recommend this location! All bedding, towels, music he provides, wifi, and many other extras were better than a five star hotel.\\nWe had a lovely time in Philippe's cute little Paris apartment! It is situated in a sweet neighborhood within comfortable walking distance to the tube and major sights like Notre Dame and the Louvre. It felt that we were \\\"\\\"living\\\"\\\" in Paris instead of just being a tourist. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi was good. Philippe was a wonderful host! He helped us find the apartment when we got lost, helped us drag our 3 very large suitcases up 4 flights of stairs and even called a taxi for our departure since I couldn't pronounce the street names. The shower and toilet were a bit small and tricky to manage, but nothing too difficult. Overall we had a fabulous time and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone in the future!\\nThis was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience. The apartment was just as it was presented on the site and exactly what I was looking for. The host was very helpful,the appartment was clean, and we slept like babes each night with the window open on our top floor abode. the apartment was just a 10 minute walk away from Notre Dame. I was able to make breakfast each morning on our petite stove top. Thank you again. We would definitely stay again.\\nThis apartment although small is great. Ideally located in the heart of the Marais it's newly refurbished and nicely done.\\nAnne fell in love with Philippe's apartment and now wants to move to Paris and live in it! It's very large and has big windows with lots of light. It's also in a great location. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Censier Daubenton station on the #7 Metro line which goes right to the Louvre. About a 15 minute walk to the RER B line which goes directly to the Gare du Nord (Railroad station) and all the way to CDG airport. And best of all, it's a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Rue Mouffetard, one of the oldest streets in Paris, with a bustling, permanent street market. If you love food, you'll love Rue Mouffetard! Philippe gave us great directions on the best way to get to and from his apartment. He met us there with two sets of keys, as requested, and communication with him was easy. We'll definitely be contacting him again on our next trip to Paris.\\nThe reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\\nThank you for a good stay. The location of the apartment is excellent and the apartment was exactly what I needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. Philippe was very helpful.\\nPhilippe's flat is great. Very clean, new and charmant. It's in the heart of Paris, in the lovely (email hidden)ly neighborhood crowded with nice caf\\u00e9s, restaurants, great shops and museums. Philippe was very kind, the appartment has a coffee and a tea machine available, we enjoyed having breakfast at home in the morning. We are looking forward to go back to Paris!\\nWe went to Paris to watch our son in the Marathon and had a sunny weekend in this wonderfully light and artfully decorated apartment. We felt wonderfully at home and comfortable among the artworks and velvet and slept deeply on the excellent beds. A great location and a wonderful space from which to venture forth and explore the cultural richness fo Paris.\\nPhilippe was very attentive and helpful! And the location of the apartment is excellent! Thanks very much for everything!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
